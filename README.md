# ECG Enabler

## Features

Enable ECG function anywhere with Apple Watch S4+ which is bought from ECG-enabled region.

From iOS 12.2 and above, you must connect to a cellular network of ECG enabled countries / regions to enable ECG function of Apple Watch, which is inconvenient for whom buy Apple Watch from overseas.
This can bypass the cellular network check.

This tweak is based on [my research](https://hiraku.tw/2019/10/4951/). However, with function hooking, you don't need to pair Apple Watch again, like the original post for non-jailbroken iPhone.

## Requirement

Apple Watch S4+ which is bought from [ECG enabled countries / regions](https://www.apple.com/watchos/feature-availability/#branded-ecg).

## Notice
1. If it doesn't work, unpair your Apple Watch and pair again without restoring settings (watch backups).
2. Once ECG is enabled on your Apple Watch, you can remove this tweak.
3. You can restore rootFS / unjailbreak and keep this hack working.
4. Reset all setttings / erase all content and settings / restore var snapshot from your iPhone would make you lose this hack.

## Install

ECG Enabler is available on BigBoss repo. Just install it with your favorite package manager.
